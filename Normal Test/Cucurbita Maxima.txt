'''''Cucurbita maxima''''', one of at least five species of cultivated [[Squash (plant)|squash]], is one of the most diverse domesticated species, perhaps with more cultivated forms than any other crop.<ref>Esquinas-Alcazar, J.T. and P.J.

Different squash types of this species were introduced into North America as early as the 16th century. By the American Revolution, the species was in cultivation by Native American tribes throughout the present-day United States. By the early 19th century, at least three varieties are known to have been commercially introduced in North America from seeds obtained from Native Americans. Secondary centers of diversity include [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Burma]], and possibly the southern [[Appalachians]]. The large red-orange squashes often seen at Halloween in the United States are ''C. maxima'', but not to be confused with the orange type used for jack-o-lanterns, which are ''C. pepo''.
